        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>No bakes are a type of cookie which - you guessed it! - aren't baked. They're delicious balls of chocolate, peanut butter, and oats, held together by the science of candy-making. But don't let the idea of candy-making scare you away! These are so easy to whip up that you could cook a batch every day (and after tasting them, you just might want to!)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 stick (8 tbsp) of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cocoa powder</li>
            <li>2/3 cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Stir in the brown sugar, milk, and cocoa powder until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Allow the mixture to heat to a rolling boil. Boil for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove mixture from heat and mix in peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt until the peanut butter is dissolved.</li>
            <li>Mix in oats.</li>
            <li>Using a spoon, create small balls of the mixture and place on wax paper.</li>
            <li>Allow to set until hardened. Placing the cookies in the fridge can help them set more quickly.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
