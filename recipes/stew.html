        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef stew is so delicious and hearty, and also so easy to make! For maximum convenience, I like to use a crockpot. Toss everything into the crockpot in the morning, and by the time you come home from work, you'll have a wonderful meal waiting for you. I suggest serving it with some bread or rolls!</p>
