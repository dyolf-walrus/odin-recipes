        <p class="description">The first time I had chicken scampi at Olive Garden, I fell in love with it. I wanted to learn how to make it myself and found the perfect recipe! While this isn't the easiest or quickest dish to make, it is definitely worth the effort. Try this garlicky, creamy sauce over noodles with sliced bell peppers and onions, and I'm sure you'll instantly fall in love, too!</p>
